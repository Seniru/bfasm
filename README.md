# bfasm
> Brainfuck interpreter written in Assembly

### Usage
```bash
./bf [file]
```

### Why assembly?
There are 2 reasons to choose assembly as the primary developement language for this projrect.
Number one, and the primary reasons is to just flex on people. Both assembly and brainfuck are considered to be some hardcore stuff among many people. That being said, I'm not the smartest person alive. So if there are any issues in these codes, I'd love to humbly listen and learn.
Reason number two is that brainfuck feels very close to assembly. It is just incrementing and decrementing stuff, moving around places, and doing basic I/O.

### Building
```bash
# first clone the repo
